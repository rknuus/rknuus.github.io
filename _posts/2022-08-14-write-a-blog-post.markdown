## Structure your posts

Use level 2 (`##`) and if necessary level 3 (`###`) titles to structure your posts.

## Display code snippets

You can display a block of code like the following using triple backticks. 
You can also specify the language after the first triple backticks.

```python
def hello(name):
    return f'hello {name}'
```

## Add images

Create an `assets` folder where you can put all your images, 
then display them with a link starting with an exclamative mark like this: 
`![my inspiring image]({{ "/assets/sample-image.jpg" | relative_url }})`.

![my inspiring image]({{ "/assets/sample-image.jpg" | relative_url }})
