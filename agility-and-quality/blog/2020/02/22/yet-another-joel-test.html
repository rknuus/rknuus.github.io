<h2 id="the-original-test">The original test</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You probably know <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">The Joel Test</a>. Based on 12 simple questions it was designed to measure the quality of a software team, but it also tells a lot about the culture of the organization the software team is working for. So assessing it is useful if you consider to apply for a job at that organization.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="the-test-revisited">The test revisited</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/">Joel Test</a> is almost 20 years old. There are new takes on the test like <a href="https://dev.to/checkgit/the-joel-test-20-years-later-1kjk">The Joel Test: 20 Years Later</a>, slightly refining some questions and adding a 13th one. The conclusion is that the test is still relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="addendum-14-do-you-identify-flaky-tests-and-instable-infrastructure">Addendum: 14. Do you identify flaky tests and instable infrastructure?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An addendum related to the engineering culture I&#8217;d like to add is the evaluation of the reliability of the tests and the infrastructure (e.g. the build server). It&#8217;s easy to setup CI/CD to work a few times, but if the result is not almost perfectly reliable, what&#8217;s the point of CI/CD?!</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="a-personal-take">A personal take</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides a reasonable <a href="https://dev.to/checkgit/the-joel-test-20-years-later-1kjk">extended Joel Test</a> score my personal criteria for a decent job are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is it interesting, so that I&#8217;d enjoy work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the team highly qualified, so that I&#8217;d learn on a regular basis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I relate my daily work to the larger organization goals, increasing my intrinsic motivation?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one is probably easy to answer, because that&#8217;s what interviewees usually focus on. For the other two I suggest the following tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="assess-team-qualification">Assess team qualification</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="15-do-some-team-members-attend-present-at-public-conferences">15. Do some team members attend &amp; present at public conferences?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are too many <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx">Dark Matter Developers</a>. They focus on getting things done. Obviously, that&#8217;s good. But they also don&#8217;t read many blogs, attend conferences, or local meetups. This keeps them trapped in their bubble forever. That&#8217;s why I want to have at least some explorative minds in your team.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="16-do-you-run-internal-knowledge-sharing-sessions">16. Do you run internal knowledge sharing sessions?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Equally important as exchanging with the world outside your organization is to learn from each other. You can do traditional talks or present interesting content in the format of <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/dailycpp/">Dailies</a>. You can also watch recorded talks and discuss the implications on your work. It can be as simple as ordering pizza and drinks for everybody and hosting a lunch &amp; learn.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="17-do-you-do-code-reviews">17. Do you do code reviews?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code reviews sometimes are used to ensure quality. I prefer to think of code reviews primarily as an exchange of knowledge. The reviewers learn what has changed recently, and the author learns possible improvements suggested by the reviewers. I believe reviews are crucial to avoid knowledge silos.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="relate-daily-work-to-larger-goals">Relate daily work to larger goals</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="18-does-your-organization-have-a-vision-mission">18. Does your organization have a vision &amp; mission?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost every organization has a vision and/or mission statement. Sometimes the vision &amp; mission perfectly matches what you would like to do. Other times they look artificial. In any case it should be interesting to ask blue collar workers about their opinion on the organization&#8217;s vision &amp; mission.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="19-do-you-have-a-team-vision-mission-and-is-it-related-to-the-organization-vision-mission">19. Do you have a team vision &amp; mission and is it related to the organization vision &amp; mission?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/book">Measure What Matters</a> by John Doerr: "Contributors are most engaged when they can actually see how their work contributes to the companyâ€™s success." If your work feels meaningful, if your contribution clearly has a purpose, your intrinsic motivation raises. The interesting question is whether the team vision &amp; mission is explicitly articulated and whether everybody agrees on it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="20-do-you-measure-by-how-much-you-reach-organizational-team-goals">20. Do you measure by how much you reach organizational &amp; team goals?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting goals (e.g. as <a href="../../../2020/01/01/introducing-okrs.html">OKRs</a>) is not easy but also not impossible. The next step is even harder: to measure outcome. Multiple organization I worked with did bi-annual performance evaluations, where you just had to provide convincing arguments why you didn&#8217;t do what you planned to do a year ago. So it was highly subjective. I prefer less hand-wavy ways to evaluate whether goals are met. It&#8217;s not the end of the world to not fully achieve a goal (see below). So let&#8217;s be honest about it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="21-do-you-celebrate-failure">21. Do you celebrate failure?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nobody is perfect. That&#8217;s why no one in his right mind expects constant success. But how do you deal with failures? Do you play the blame game, do you begin to sandbag and underpromise? Are you put under increasing pressure, because the delivery date must be held?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or are you perfectly allowed to fail? Are you encouraged to risk something? Do you keep risks managable by running small experiments? And do you learn from failures?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
